              <h2>Join Department</h2>
              <p>The fire department is staffed entirely by paid-on-call firefighters and officers. Personnel respond to emergencies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and are notifed about calls for service via portable pagers and cell phone alerts. Depending on the nature of the call, responders may come to the station to pickup an apparatus or may go directly to the scene in their own car. All personnel must uphold the standard operating procedures and regulations of the fire department.</p>
              <p>Becoming a firefighter is rewarding and challenging. This is a great way to be involved in the community, to be a part of the solution when emergencies happen, and to gain valuable skills and experience. All firefighers are required to acheive at least Fire Fighter I training and certification from the Michigan Fire Fighter Training Division. This training is offered in Lake County every other year and is free of charge. Personnel may also persue a Medical First Responder license and provide MFR-level care on medical emergencies.</p>
              <h3>Duties</h3>
              <ul>
                  <li>Attend required department trainings and meetings</li>
                  <li>Respond to calls for fire suppression, fire alarm investigation, motor vehicle accidents, technical rescue, and other types of emergencies</li>
                  <li>Respond to Priority 1, 2, and 3 medical calls and assist EMS</li>
                  <li>Participate in community events and functions</li>
                  <li>Drive department vehicles and apparatus</li>
                  <li>Maintain equipment and clean the station</li>
                  <li>Uphold firefighter certifications and/or medical licensure by taking continuing education classes</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Training</h3>
              <p>All firefighters must complete Fire Fighter I certification at minimum (Fire Fighter II is preferred.) In order to provide medical care, firefighters must also earn a Michigan Medical First Responder license. There are continuing education requirements for firefighter certifications and the MFR license. The department conducts in-house training at least once a month. All needed training is provided at no cost.</M>  </p>
